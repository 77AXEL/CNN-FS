# üß† CNN from Scratch 

This project is a simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented **entirely from scratch** using only low-level libraries like NumPy, PIL, and SciPy‚Äî**no deep learning frameworks** (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) are used. It includes image preprocessing, convolution and pooling operations, ReLU and softmax activations, forward/backward propagation, cuda support allowing accelerated training and inference and a fully connected classifier.

## üñº Dataset Structure

Make sure your dataset folder is structured like this:

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ class1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.png
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ class2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.png
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ class../
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ..
..
```

Each subfolder represents a class (e.g., `cat`, `dog`), and contains sample images.
> To help you get started, we‚Äôve included a [starter `data` folder](https://github.com/77AXEL/CNN-FS/tree/main/data) with example class directories.

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Image Preprocessing**:

   * Each image is resized to a fixed size and normalized.
   * Filters (e.g., sharpening, edge detection) are applied using 2D convolution.
   * ReLU activation and 2√ó2 max-pooling reduce spatial dimensions.

2. **Feature Vector**:

   * Flattened pooled feature maps are fed into fully connected layers.

3. **Feedforward + Softmax**:

   * Dense layers compute activations followed by a softmax for classification.

4. **Backpropagation**:

   * Gradients are computed layer-by-layer.
   * Weights and biases are updated using basic gradient descent.

## üõ† Setup

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/77AXEL/CNN-FS.git
```

## ‚úÖ Training

Update and run the training block:

```python
from cnnfs.model import CNN

model = CNN()
model.cuda(True) # or False if you don't want to use cuda
model.init(
    image_size=64,
    batch_size=32,
    h1=128,
    h2=64,
    learning_rate=0.001,
    epochs=400,
    dataset_path="data", # Your dataset folder path
    max_image=200, # If not specified, the model will load all images for each class
    filters=[
        [[0, -1, 0], [-1, 5, -1], [0, -1, 0]],
        [[1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1]],
        [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 8, -1], [-1, -1, -1]]
    ] # If not specified, the model will use its own default filters
)
model.load_dataset() # Processes all images for each class to prepare them for later use in training
model.train_model(visualize=True) # Starts model training based on the classes in your dataset with optional visualization support
model.save_model() # Stores the trained model's weights and biases in a model.bin file
```

---

## üîç Predicting New Images

```python
model.load_model("model.bin") # Load the trained model
prediction = model.predict("test_images/mycat.png") # Applies the trained model to classify the input image
print("Predicted class:", prediction)
```

---

## üí° Example Filters Used

```text
[ [0, -1,  0],   Sharpen
  [-1, 5, -1],
  [0, -1,  0] ]

[ [1,  0, -1],   Edge detection
  [1,  0, -1],
  [1,  0, -1] ]

[[-1, -1, -1],   Laplacian
 [-1,  8, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1] ]
```

## üìä Performance

| Metric   | Value (example)      |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Accuracy | \~90% (binary class) |
| Epochs   | 10‚Äì50                |
| Dataset  | Custom / \~8000 imgs |

* A larger dataset and more training epochs typically lead to higher accuracy.
